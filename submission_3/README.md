 "2,000 words (includes all introductory and discussion material in the main text, any footnotes, acknowledgments, and appendices; does not include 150-word abstract, Method or Results sections (except footnotes), cover page, Author Contributions, or reference list)

The Method and Results sections of Research Articles do not count toward the total word count limit. The aim here is to allow authors to provide clear, complete, self-contained descriptions of their studies. But as much as Psychological Science prizes narrative clarity and completeness, so too does it value concision. In almost all cases, an adequate account of method and results can be achieved in 2,500 or fewer words for Regular Articles. Methodological minutiae and fine-grained details on the Results—the sorts of information that only “insiders” would relish and require for purposes of replication—should be placed in SOM-R, not in the main text.

Many Research Articles contain two or more studies. Such submissions may include “interim” introductions and discussions that bracket the studies, in addition to an opening “general” introduction and a closing “general” discussion. Authors who opt for this sort of organization should bear in mind that the aforementioned word limits on introductory and Discussion sections include both interim and general varieties. Any combined “Results and Discussion” sections will be counted toward the word limit.

Narrative material that belongs in the introductory or Discussion sections should not be placed in the Method or Results section, within reasonable limits. Thus, for example, authors may include a few sentences to place their findings in context when they are presented in the Results section. However, excessive packing of a Method or Results section with material appropriate to the introduction or Discussion will trigger immediate revision or rejection of the manuscript. Hybrid “Methods & Results” sections are disallowed for any type of submission."

things to do
1) does my method section comply with this?

2) "Authors must include effect sizes for their major results and distributional information in their graphs (or tables, for that matter).  In addition, exact p values should be reported for all results greater than .001; p values below this range should be described as “p < .001.” Authors should be particularly attentive to APA style when typing statistical details (e.g., Ns for chi-square tests, formatting of dfs)"

3) "There is no single right answer to this question, but authors must explain (in the submission portal and in the manuscript) why they believe their sample size is appropriate."

Thank you
