Reviewer #1: 
- gender analysis, inference from te null + power given the sample size - gender analysis removed
- literature about link between alcohol and domestic abuse - replaced para with suggested literature
- confusion about whether domestic abuse includes parent to child abuse - made clear that it involves both IPV and family
- confusion about how domestic abuse cases were identified - clarified variable selection
- no data on whether they watched the football - no action
- alc coefficient in table reflects base rate - no action
- gap between how coefficients were described and presented - fixed hopefully
- number of matches table required - added

Reviewer #2:
- confusion about how coefficients were presented - fixed hopefully
- model needs to be explicitly stated - model stated
- test of overdispersion not explained - overdispersion explained
- clarify that there are two counts for each day - clarified
- state software package - stated
- separate models for alcohol and non-alcohol - done
- issue with kirby coefficients - one of them does not match, don't think the issue is on my side, emailed them - no reply, i think they made a mistake
- coefficients confusion  - but fixed hopefully
- how was alcohol flag determined? - added sentence
- how was victim and perpetrator determined - added sentence
- missing data on alcohol - no missing data added sentence
- title of paper is incorrect  - changed title
- summary of data - added plot
- something about the gender perspective but sentence is not finished - no action
- IPV abbreviation - clarified

Reviewer #3: 
- present 95% cis instead - done
- interaction in non-linear model can't be interpreted as % increase compared to baseline - point taken, removed interaction
- abstract headline figure not in main text 
- careful with "results in" suggests causality
- descriptive stats in the methods - removed
- ipv not defined and other abbreciations (CI, AIC)
- overdispersion not explained -added para
- logistic regression not explained
- statistical software - done
- flow diagram illsutrating the number of excluded and included records - hopefully explained
- summary stats - added plot
- confidence intervals instead of p values -done
- temporal dynamics should be moved to methods -done
- what is the benchmark in the three hour analysis - added sentence explaining that these are dummies
- more info about the rugby analysis - how many matches, the more tournament/match days there are, 
the more power the analysis will have to pick up on an effect. Do all of the rugby matches happen on
the weekend or during a certain time of year? Could this affect the results? - clarified
- mismatch between reported size of increase in violent cases vs regression table
- lot of models we would expect 2 out of 40 p-values to be signif by chance alone
- inference from the null - power issues with other types of offences
- logistic models explanation

Reviewer #4:
- seems to believe that because the victories were not unexpected, this cannot be a causal effect
- says that the fact that the increase starts in the three hour period of the match supports this
- his/her narrative is that the increase is mainly during the match due to stressing over what's going to happen and
that the increase afterwards is residual "due to drinking"- in his view, it is not the win, but the threat to the expected win that drives this
- he argues against the claim that increased sense of englishness causes dv - i dont think i said that
- says that we'd expect fewer cases outside if policing has increased - we found no effect either way so not sure why this is important

Reviewer #5: 
-missing data for 2017 - data quality issues
-HMIC investigation led to an increase in recorded domestic abuse crimes in 2013 (Policing, Vol 12, No 2, pp. 150-164 ) - needs to be discussed how does this affect the data? April 2013
- how alcohol identified- reliability of the variable?
- something about the alcohol having gender bias but not really clear
- is it related to victimm or perpetrator
- why christmas and new years eve singled out
