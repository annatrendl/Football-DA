Why do men abuse women?


Why are men more likely to abuse their female intimate partner after watching sport [REFS? or begin of second para]?

We use a dataset of X,000,000 incidents and crimes in one of England's largest police forces, matched to dates of the three World Cups and two Eurothingies between 20XX and 20XX.

We find a 60\% increase in alcohol-related domestic abuse when England wins a world cup or Euro match. 

[This is a large effect, as large as ... sentence about how the effect compares to Christmas, or the effect of a weekday]

The increase reduces to baseline in the three hour period after the game.

The abuse increase does not depend upon whether the abuse is in or away from the home.

We find the increase does not generalise to non-alcohol related domestic abuse and does not generalise to male-on-male or female-on-male, or female on female domestic abuse abuse. 

The effect is not seen for public order offenses, other violent crimes, and property related crimes.  

Football is not the trigger which precipitates abuse with would otherwise occur later. 

Football-related abuse occurs just as soon as other non-football abuse. 

The football related incidents are just as likely to be new incidents of abuse as are non-football incidents. 


Whether the previous incident is alcohol involved is irrelavant.

Theoretical theme :

toxic masculinity, pressure cooker, does alcohol _CAUSE_ abuse, football changes reporting not actual abuse.

Together, this suggests Football-related abuse is just like other abuse.
