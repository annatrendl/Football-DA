# Football-DA
code for performing the analysis on the effect of football on DA

Things to check please:
1) I've rewritten the abstract so that it complies with the guidelines (see link in the tex file)
2) Page 7 - description of gender group results paragraph
3) Page 12 - First para of dicussion - claiming causality
4) Page 15 - Reporting number of days/hours regressions for repeated cases - emmeans only gives me a ratio and I am not sure what's the proper way to turn it into a difference in the response scale. Also I generally tried to avoid quoting numbers from the appendix.
5) Page 17 last para - conclusion
6) Cover letter please check

Thank you
