Submitted Lancet Public Health.

Rejected, minimal commentary from editor.


My summary:
I think these reviews were overall quite positive. In some ways I think we were unlucky.

Maybe we want to look at how the exponentiated coefficients are presented and explained, as two of them misunderstood this and thought it meant we did it completely wrong.
I think we need to include Card and Dahl in the references.
We should include a little more detail on the AI flag, and how DA is defined in these incidents/crimes.



Reviewer 1

Generally very positive, had minor comments about updated references for alcohol-DA, more clarification on definition of DA incidents vs. non-crimes and info on age difference of suspect-victim.


Reviewer 2

Seems to hate us, and I think some of the comments reflect starting with a negative assumption. 
Seems to me they misunderstood the analysis in a few ways. Is it worth looking at the framing, or not subtracting one after exponentiating? (I suspect not, it might just be one person who misunderstood, or didn't read carefully) 
Didn't get that everything is recorded/identified by the police, perhaps half a sentence to make this hit-you-between-the-eyes explicit (though I thought we already had somethign like that) 


Reviewer 3

Also seems to have misunderstood the analysis and exponentiated etc. 
They make a lot of other minor comments, but I'm not too worried about them. Perhaps suggests we should have more detail around overdispersion and logistic vs poisson.


Reviewer 4

I think this might be Card or Dahl. They are really clutching at straws to make an alternative causality argument that would fit with that QJE paper, and refer to beating "their own women", which makes me want to ignore their comments on principle.
I do think we need to include the Card and Dahl paper in our references though. It's so famous that if we leave it out, it looks like we don't know the literature.
Perhaps worth including a sentence saying that the causality could be either a win or "anticipation of a win"? But maybe too niche a criticism to bother with.


Reviewer 5

Generally positive. Identify criticisms of the data which are completely irrelevant to our results/analyses. Ask for more detail on AI flag, and definitions of DA non-crime DA incidents.
