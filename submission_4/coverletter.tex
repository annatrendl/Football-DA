\opening{Dear Editors,} % Addressed to the editor in chief

Please consider our manuscript ``The role of alcohol in the link between football and domestic abuse: evidence from England'' for publication as an Article in \textit{Palgrave Communications}. Previous studies have suggested a link between football and domestic abuse in the context of England, but the exact nature of this relationship, including the extent to which alcohol alters it, has not yet been explored. Understanding the characteristics of the link between football and domestic abuse will deepen our understanding of the pathway through which football increases propensity for violence, and can inform preventive policy measures.


Our results show that the number of reported alcohol-related domestic abuse cases increases by 61\% following an England victory
in a national football tournament, while there is no effect on non-alcohol related domestic abuse. This effect is specific to male-to-female cases, and its time course is strongly consistent with a causal link between England's victory and an increase in alcohol-related domestic abuse. We also find a comparable increase in other, violent, male to female, alcohol-related offences on England win days. These results strongly implicate masculinity construction and alcohol consumption as the pathway through which football increases male-perpetrated violence against women. In addition, we find that national rugby tournaments have no comparable effects on the reported number of domestic abuse cases. To test the robustness of the win-effect, our study also involves a re-analysis of data used in a previous study. 

We would like to suggest Kath Woodward as a potential reviewer. We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere, is not under consideration by another journal, and had not been discussed with a Palgrave Communications Editorial Board Member.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
